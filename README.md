# React Todo App
### Requirements
- Node.js (8.5.0 or above)

### Getting started

1. Navigate to root project folder and install node modules:

    `npm install`

2. Since browsers can't read JSX, we need to transpile our JSX code
with Babel and Webpack. An NPM script has already been defined
for this:

    `npm run webpack`

    Alternatively, keep Webpack running in the background
    and compiling any changes made by running this script:

    `npm run webpack:watch`

3. Next, start the server:

    `npm start`
